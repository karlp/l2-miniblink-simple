# l2-miniblink - Laks v2 miniblink test repository

## Purpose
A repository of "miniblink" for laks.  Initially this is targetting the modern world of
strange and delightful riscv parts.  Eventually, it will include ~all other parts supported by laks.

This lets you test out your riscv toolchains, your c++ toolchain, and your masochism tolerance level.

It is based on the "v2" of laks.  This is "the future!"

## Notes
As a miniblink repository, similar in style to [https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3-miniblink/](libopencm3-miniblink)
this is probably _not_ a good example of how to setup your own project, unless you're also planning on building for
multiple targets in the same source tree.
